# Transient State menus

Transient state menus make it simple to run commands multiple times, using a single key press, from a specific sub-set of commands.

For example, Font Scaling transient state menu allows you to repeatedly increase the size of the buffer font just by using the `+` key.  The Font Scaling transient state menu contains the sub-set of commands related to scaling, so you can decrease the font size just with the `-` key and reset the font with `0`.

Transient-states are usually triggered by using a keybinding with the following pattern: `<Leader> <group> .` where group is the category the transient-state falls under.

When in a transient-state you will see documentation at the bottom of your window. To exit a transient-state press q.
