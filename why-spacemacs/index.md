# Why Spacemacs

Spacemacs provides highly productive tooling for any software development, supporting numerous languages and common development tools.

Spacemacs takes the raw power of Emacs and adds years of experience from the community.

Spacemacs uses Vim modal editing by default, providing simple keybindings for common tasks and dramatically enhancing productivity (and fun).
