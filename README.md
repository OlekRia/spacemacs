![Spacemacs Practicalli - interactive development with Clojure and Emacs, using CIDER](images/practicalli-spacemacs-book-banner.png)

This is an introduction to developing Clojure applications using Emacs, specifically based on the Spacemacs configuration for Emacs and CIDER.  The aim is to help you be productive with those tools as quickly as possible.

Spacemacs is a community-driven project that provides a simple way to add lots of extra functionality to Emacs, without having to manage packages yourself or spend time writing common configuration code.

This workshop will cover the following topics:
* Emacs basics, common commands and tools
* Powerful editing and refactor tools (iedit, narrowing, helm-ag, multiple cursors, visual undo)
* Adding and enhancing the Clojure layer
* Running the REPL, evaluating code, inspecting data, debug, reloaded workflow
* Running tests & test reports
* Structural editing (smartparens/evil-cleverparens)
* Clojure docs, auto-completion, snippets
* Clojurescript development, figwheel-main and reagent
* Org-mode for project documentation, literate programming & presentations

> This is not a guide to customising Emacs for Clojure development, except were there are useful additions to be made to Spacemacs and the Clojure layer.
