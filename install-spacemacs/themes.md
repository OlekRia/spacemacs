# Adding Themes to Spacemacs

Themes are included by adding the theme name to the `dotspacemacs-themes` list.  The first theme in the list is loaded when Spacemacs starts.

```lisp
dotspacemacs-themes '(doom-gruvbox-light
                      doom-gruvbox
                      spacemacs-dark
                      spacemacs-light
                      cyberpunk)
```

The order of the themes in the list is the order Spacemacs will cycle through those themes, `SPC T n` for the next theme and `SPC T p` for the previous theme.

The first time you select a theme it will be automatically downloaded, installed and used.  This may take a few seconds to load.

> #### Hint::Doom Gruvbox Themes used for this guide
> This guide uses the `doom-gruvbox-light` theme for screenshots and videos, some older screenshots are `doom-solarized-light` or `spacemacs-dark`.

## Example themes

There are many [themes available](http://themegallery.robdor.com/) for Spacemacs that will change the colours of text, background, etc.

> #### Hint::Original Emacs theme ?
> Add `(disable-theme)` to `dotspacemacs/user-config` section of `.spacemacs` to remove any custom theme and use the Emacs default colors.  Or set `(dotspacemacs-themes '(default))` in `.spacemacs` to use a theme similar to the Emacs colors.

This guide uses the minimal theme provided by doom modeline and doom-gruvbox-light theme.

Doom Solarized Light is also an excellent theme for working during the day, as well as presentations and videos due to a lighter color set having a better contrast.

Doom Solarized Dark is a good theme for darker environments.

Spacemacs has two default themes included, one light and one dark.  There are also many [themes available](http://themegallery.robdor.com/) that you can select and load on demand, `SPC T s`.

The cyberpunk theme used a very striking color palette, familiar to those who use to use Emacs Live distribution (now deceased).
