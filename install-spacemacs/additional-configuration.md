# Additional Configuration for Spacemacs

If you did not use the practicalli/spacemacs.d configuration, then use the following sections to configure Spacemacs for Clojure development and other useful features.


## Spacemacs install Wizard
Run Emacs as normal.

Spacemacs will ask how to configure the fundamentals of Spacemacs operation.

The `.spacemacs` configuration file is created by the Spacemacs Wizard, which only runs if it does not find this file, or `.spacemacs.d/init.el` file.

For the preferred style, select *Among the stars aboard the Evil flagship (vim)*

For the distribution, select *The Standard Distribution (spacemacs)*

Spacemacs will now download all its Emacs packages and this will take several minutes, depending on the speed of your connection to the Internet.

`SPC q r` to restart Spacemacs once all the packages have downloaded.  This is not strictly necessary, but helps ensure the packages are working correctly.

## Spacemacs is ready for action

Spacemacs is now up and running and ready to take on the world.

Next task is to configure Spacemacs for Clojure.
