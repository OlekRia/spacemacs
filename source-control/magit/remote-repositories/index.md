# Working with Remote Repositories

Magit provides tools for working with remote repositories

* [add a remote repository](add-remote.md) to a local repository
* [clone remote repositories](clone.md)
* [checkout remote branches and track them](checkout-remote-branch.md), including the [branch of a pull request](try-pull-requests.md)
* [pull commits](pull-changes.md)
* [push commits](push-changes.md)

Magit Forge can also [create and fork a remote repository](../forge/forks.md), as well as [manage issues and pull requests](../forge/).
