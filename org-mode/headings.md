# Org-mode Headings

Organise text content with multiple levels of headings.  Focus on sections by expanding and folding the content under headings, to show the level of information required at a particular time. [TODO states](todo-states.md) can be applied to any level of headings.

`C-RTN` to create a heading at the same level of parent (top level heading if no parent)

`C-S-RTN` to create a heading with the [TODO state](todo-states.md), providing a visual marker of progress.

`o` on a heading creates a new line automatically indented for text, to which a list item, `-` or check box list, `- [ ]`, can be added.

### Collapse / Expand headings

`TAB` expands / collapses the heading at the current cursor position.

`S-TAB` will cycle through expanding and collapsing headings at different levels.


### Moving headings and content around

Items can be moved to change the order they appear, avoiding the need to cut and paste.
