# Inspecting values in Clojure

The Clojure layer includes the `cider-inspector`

`, d v` opens the `cider-inspector` on the current symbol, allowing you to traverse its value.

> #### Hint:: Clojure Inspector in more detail
> The `cider-inspector` is covered in more detail in the [Evaluate Clojure > Inspect section](/evaluating-clojure/inspect.md)
>
> An example of using the Inspector can be seen in the [REPL driven development with Spacemacs video](https://youtu.be/NDrpclY54E0).
